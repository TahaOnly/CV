                Now that I know you're interested, let me tell you more about myself. I was born in Kot Radha Kishan, Kasur. My family moved to Lahore soon after my birth.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                I am a CS major at <b>Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)</b>. I work as the CEO of <b>Sutoon</b>, an NGO I started in 2016 with three close friends. 
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                I spend a lot of time reading about Startups, Product Design, and Management, and have recently started learning more about storytelling and design thinking. I also love exploring the heritage in Lahore. Occasionally I visit Old Lahore and Mughalpura to experience the glorious Mughal architecture.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                I hope that whatever work I do unites my various passions, and brings lasting impact to communities around me.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                Feel free to email me at <b>23100098@lums.edu.pk</b>! I love meeting with people in person, so if you're currently based in Lahore feel free to reach out for a (socially distanced) cup of coffee!

                I conducted three science-based internships in Dar-ul-Ehsaas and set up a sustainable computer lab of 10 computers in an orphanage where programming was taught to the students. We have launched multiple projects, two of which I have personally mentored, inclusing CyberAllies, Synoptics, Urdu Revitalization, Tehqeeq, and Orelion.
